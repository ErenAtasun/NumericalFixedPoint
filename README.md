#📐 Fixed Point Iteration with JSON Input and Output
A Python implementation of the Fixed Point Iteration method for solving equations, with an intuitive workflow for JSON-based input and output. This project simplifies mathematical computations and presents results in a programmatically accessible format.

📝 Project Overview
The Fixed Point Iteration method is used to approximate the roots of equations. This project:

Reads input parameters (function, initial guess, tolerance, etc.) from a JSON file.
Performs the iteration and computes results.
Writes detailed iteration results and final output into a JSON file for easy interpretation and usage.
💻 Features
JSON-based Input/Output: Simplifies parameter setup and results retrieval.
Error Tracking: Tracks and outputs the error after each iteration.
Convergence Check: Indicates whether the solution meets the given tolerance.
Detailed Iteration Logs: Saves all intermediate steps for analysis.
