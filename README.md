Fixed Point Iteration with JSON Input and Output
Project Description
This project implements the Fixed Point Iteration method to find the root of a function. It accepts user input in the form of a JSON file, including the function, initial guess, tolerance value, and maximum number of iterations. The results are written to an output JSON file. The project aims to simplify mathematical computations and present results in a programmatically accessible format.

Technologies and Tools Used
Python: The project is written in Python.
JSON: Input and output data are handled in JSON format.
